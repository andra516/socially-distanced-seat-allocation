# Seat-Allocation-Project-Sum2021

This is the repository for my Seat Allocation Project with the University of Birmingham during the summer of 2021.

The project is to design a GUI that will make the process of recording seat locations in lecture halls easier than the current method (which is v. time consuming as it requires manual clicking and concatenation of arrays), with the hope to increase the capacity of lecture halls at UoB and at other universities :)

I'm writing the GUI in Python using PyQt5, however the original code was written in MATLAB. Currently I'm using a Python version of a seat allocation algorithm to decide locations of viable seats, although I plan on translating some of the original MATLAB to give multiple choices on the algorithm used to maximise the capacity of halls.

My supervisors for this project are Richard Mason and Jonathan Watkins.
