# Seat-Allocation-Project-Sum2021

This is the repository for my Seat Allocation Project with the University of Birmingham during the summer of 2021.

The project is to design a GUI that will make the process of recording seat locations in lecture halls easier than the current method - which requires manual clicking on seats in small batches and manual concatenation of seat coordinate arrays. It's my hope that this software will help the process of seat allocation in lecture halls at UoB and beyond :).

I'm writing the UI in Python using PyQt5, and am using a translated version of some pre-existing code - originally written in MATLAB - as a Python backend. Currently the software offers the user the optionality of choosing between two algorithms: `jonsAllocator` or `richardsAllocator` with which seating solutions may be found.

My supervisors for this project are Richard Mason and Jonathan Watkins - thanks for all your help guys :)
